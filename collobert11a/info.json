    "abstract": "We propose a unified neural network architecture and learning algorithm that can be applied to various natural language processing tasks including part-of-speech tagging, chunking, named entity recognition, and semantic role labeling.  This versatility is achieved by trying to avoid task-specific engineering and therefore disregarding a lot of prior knowledge.  Instead of exploiting man-made input features carefully optimized for each task, our system learns internal representations on the basis of vast amounts of mostly unlabeled training data.  This work is then used as a basis for building a freely available tagging system with good performance and minimal computational requirements.",
