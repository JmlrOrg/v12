    "abstract": "We provide consistent random algorithms for sequential decision under partial monitoring, when the decision maker does not observe the outcomes but receives instead random feedback signals. Those algorithms have no internal regret in the sense that, on the set of stages  where the decision maker chose his action according to a given law, the average payoff could not have been improved in average by using any other fixed law.  <br> They are based on a generalization of calibration, no longer defined in terms of  a Vorono&#239; diagram but instead of a Laguerre diagram (a more general concept). This allows us to bound, for the first time in this general framework,  the expected average internal, as well as the usual external, regret at stage <i>n</i> by <i>O(n<sup>-1/3</sup>)</i>, which is known to be optimal.",
