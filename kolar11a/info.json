    "abstract": "We sharply characterize the performance of different penalization schemes for the problem of selecting the relevant variables in the multi-task setting.  Previous work focuses on the regression problem where conditions on the design matrix complicate the analysis.  A clearer and simpler picture emerges by studying the Normal means model.  This model, often used in the field of statistics, is a simplified model that provides a laboratory for studying complex procedures.",
