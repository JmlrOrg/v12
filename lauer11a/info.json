    "abstract": "This paper describes MSVMpack, an open source software package dedicated to our generic model of <i>multi-class</i> support vector machine.  All four multi-class support vector machines (M-SVMs) proposed so far in the literature appear as instances of this model. MSVMpack provides for them the first unified implementation and offers a convenient basis to develop other instances.  This is also the first parallel implementation for M-SVMs.  The package consists in a set of command-line tools with a callable library.  The documentation includes a tutorial, a user's guide and a developer's guide.",
