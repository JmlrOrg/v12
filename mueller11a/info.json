    "abstract": "The Stationary Subspace Analysis (SSA) algorithm linearly factorizes a high-dimensional time series into stationary and non-stationary components.  The SSA Toolbox is a platform-independent efficient stand-alone implementation of the SSA algorithm with a graphical user interface written in Java, that can also be invoked from the command line and from Matlab. The graphical interface guides the user through the whole process; data can be imported and exported from comma separated values (CSV) and Matlab's .mat files.",
